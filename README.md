# lapis
A lightweight shell for Wayland


### Dependencies 

Lapis relies on a few dependencies to be able to run 

- gtk4
- gtk4-layer-shell
- wayland 
- a window manager

> [!NOTE]
> Lapis has only been tested on Hyprland and Sway and so behaviour might not be optimal on your window manager of choice 



It is advised to turn off any other shell that might be running before turning on the lapis shell on your machine as they may not coexist properly.
